# rust-computational-neuro
This repo documents my foray into Computational Neuroscience, and especially using Rust. 

Specifically, there are solutions here in Rust for some of the tutorials from the book [Introduction to Computational Neuroscience](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262038256/an-introductory-course-in-computational-neuroscience/)

Over time I hope to add some utils and library-type code too.
